/**
 * The CPUAgro class represents an aggressive CPU-controlled player in the game.
 * 
 * This class extends the abstract `CPU` class and implements a specific strategy for the CPU player.
 * The CPUAgro player prioritizes playing Attack cards first, followed by Safety and Distance cards, making it an aggressive player that focuses on attacking other players.
 * The strategy is designed to prioritize offensive actions over defensive or distance-related actions.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Make decisions about which card to play, prioritizing Attack cards first.
 * - Discard cards based on the player's strategy, preferring to discard less useful cards such as Distance or Safety cards.
