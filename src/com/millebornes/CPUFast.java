/**
 * The CPUFast class represents a fast CPU-controlled player in the game.
 * 
 * This class extends the abstract `CPU` class and implements a specific strategy for the CPU player.
 * The CPUFast player prioritizes playing distance cards, and it chooses its actions based on certain game rules, such as playing a Boot card first, then a Safety card, followed by Distance cards, and finally an Attack card if no other option is available.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Make decisions about which card to play, prioritizing Distance cards, Boot cards, and Safety cards.
 * - Discard cards based on the player's strategy, with a preference for discarding Attack cards and less useful cards like Safety or Distance cards.
